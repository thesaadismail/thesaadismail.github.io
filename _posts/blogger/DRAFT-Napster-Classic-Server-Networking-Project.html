<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><u>Project Links</u><br />df<br /><br />This project was for my networking class, we had to build a Napster like server that keeps a list of availablef files<br />        <br /><div class="p1">You will build a Napster-Classic server that keeps a listing of available files at peers that connect to it. With each file the server should keep the IP address of the peer holding this file. If there are multiple peers that maintain the same file (same name), these should be shown as separate listings with different IP addresses.&nbsp;</div></div>
