I am a Mobile Developer **currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science** (concentration: human computer interaction) at Georgia Tech. 

My interests lie in **mobile computing, wearable technologies, and interconnected devices**. I believe there is a lot of opportunity in this field as we look for the next generation in computing. We will see more and more of interconnected devices, personal devices (rigs, minature devices, and etc), and systems that predict and provide you information when you need it (i.e. Google Now).

I have worked on countless projects (personal, professional, and coursework) that invovle mobile development (see [resume](/resources/resume/SaadIsmail-Resume-2014.pdf) and [personal blog](http://gremsi.com)). Currently I am taking a look at various ways of interacting with your device using a magnet and a magnetometer sensor on your device.
